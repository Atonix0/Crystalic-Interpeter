# Crystalic*Interpreter
A simple mathmaic Interpreter for me to learn the crystal programming language!
you can use this to build your own Interpeter as its really small and simple to edit 

# why i made this?
- for fun
- to learn the crystal language
- to use this structure in my feature programming languages (probably gonna rewrite this for fun but making languages became a hobby for me at this rate...) 

### sad fact: this was written with no code autocompletion );
# Features
- coolest repl i made! you will think its colors is buggy
but no it has a meaning yello for numbers green for strings
and blue for add mode! the colors change dynamicly!
- tokenizer(lexer) & Parser on the same step which gives a huge speed boost!
- interpreter
# can do 
- (8 + 8 * 8 - -8 / 8) * √π # 129.38913111610265
### this porject is finished! the only things left is a logo!
